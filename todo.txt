add more features - add multi channel coh for different freq bands.

evaluate channel by channel (evaluate different features) 
evaluate metrics per class label.
hyper par training, write results to file?

features / ccn model doesnt have expected 
data sizes? can i make my cnn variable channel sizes ?
should i pass as a param or create another cnn class?
i want it to work, feature takes epoch, returns ( single channel?) 
square tensor.

would be cool to visualise sizes of features over different
frequencies / stages. 

i dont like how atm raw is in data_io ? it should be in features.
maybe in parent class to inherit from ? 
i would enjoy to remove it but it stays for the time being...
