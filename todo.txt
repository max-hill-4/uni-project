add more features - ideally modular. :3 

do alphacoh
do [alphacoh, betapdc]
do [alphapdc, betacoh, deltacoh]

differnet sleep stages want differnet features ?
i think best is to first implement fckn all of them
then later on dynamically choose depending on what ss it is 
to reduce training time ? / reduce model complexity.



i want a script that lets me specify, features, sleep stage, hormone type
possibly also ? -> loss function and optimiser ?
 
partial directed coherance ? :D
